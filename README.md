# states_capitals_intheus

50 buttons w/States and Capitals / Live radio player with population simulator and live weather data 
This HTML and JavaScript code creates an interactive webpage displaying a list of U.S. states with live weather data, local time, and population that updates in real time. The page also provides radio stream options for each state.

## Project features:

- Luxon Library: Used for time zone handling to display the local time for each state's capital city.

- Weather Information: It fetches the current weather from the OpenWeatherMap API for each state's capital.

- Population Growth Simulation: The population updates continuously based on the specified growth rate for each state.

- Radio Stream Player: Modal windows provide buttons to switch between streams (e.g., a main stream or a country music stream) for each state.

- Code Breakdown:

- HTML: The structure of the page contains a button container where each state will have its own button representing the radio station, along with live weather, time, and population data. Modal windows are dynamically created for each state.

- CSS: The design is styled with a dark background, flexible button layout, and modal popups for the stream players. Each button displays information like the state name, capital, weather, and population.

- JavaScript:

- Station Data: Contains state-specific information, including the capital city, time zone, population, growth rate, and unique color.

- Dynamic Button Creation: Loops through the stations array to create and append buttons for each state.

- Weather API Integration: Calls the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display weather data for each state's capital.

- Real-time Data Updates: Uses setInterval to update both the population (simulating real growth) and the local time every second.
- Modals: Each state button opens a modal where users can choose between different radio streams (main and country music). Audio players are embedded into the modal to play the stream.



## The Plans on improving this project are:

- Replace the placeholder API key with your OpenWeatherMap API key.

- Audio Stream URLs: Provide actual URLs for the radio streams, which are missing in the current code.

- This setup creates a responsive and interactive UI, great for showcasing live data and radio streams for different 
  states.

-This page is presently under construction for Upgrades using javaScript
